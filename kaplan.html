                    <h3>STEP 1: Identify the topic of the question?</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the core subject of the question is the first step. Is it about cardiac care, neurological issues, communication, delegation, etc.? This helps you narrow down your focus.</p>

                    <h3>STEP 2: Are the answers assessment or implementation?</h3>
                    <p>Determine if the options provided are primarily about gathering information (assessment) or taking action (implementation). For an unstable client, implementation is often prioritized over further assessment, but for a stable client with a new issue, assessment might come first.</p>

                    <h3>STEP 3: Apply Maslow: Are the answers physical or psychosocial?</h3>
                    <p>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs guides priorities. Physiological needs (e.g., breathing, circulation, nutrition, pain management) take precedence over safety, love/belonging, esteem, or self-actualization needs.</p>

                    <h3>STEP 4: Are the answer choices related to ABCs?</h3>
                    <p>Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs) are always top priorities in nursing care. If any answer choice directly addresses a compromise in a client's airway, breathing, or circulation, it is likely the most critical intervention.</p>

                    <h3>STEP 5: What is the outcome of each of the remaining answers?</h3>
                    <p>After applying the previous steps, evaluate the remaining plausible answer choices. Consider the immediate and long-term outcomes of each action. Choose the answer that provides the most beneficial and immediate outcome for the client, asking yourself: **“If I could do only one thing and then leave, what would I do?"**</p>

                <h3>Who Do You See First? Prioritization Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Unstable vs. Stable:** Unstable clients (e.g., declining vital signs, acute distress) take priority over stable ones.</li>
                    <li>**Unexpected vs. Expected:** Unexpected findings (e.g., sudden change in condition) are prioritized over expected post-op symptoms.</li>
                    <li>**ABCs:** Airway, Breathing, Circulation are always the highest priority.</li>
                    <li>**Acute vs. Chronic:** Acute problems generally take precedence over chronic, stable conditions.</li>
                    <li>**Actual vs. Potential:** An actual problem (e.g., active bleeding) takes priority over a potential problem (e.g., risk for fall).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-section">
                <h3>Common NCLEX Traps to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not ask "Why?” (Can make clients defensive).</li>
                    <li>Do not leave the client. (Ensure client safety and continuity of care).</li>
                    <li>Do not persuade the client. (Respect client autonomy).</li>
                    <li>Do not say, "Don't worry!” (False reassurance dismisses feelings).</li>
                    <li>Do not pass the buck. (Take responsibility for your actions/assessments).</li>
                    <li>Do not read into the question. (Answer based only on the information given).</li>
                    <li>Do not 'do nothing.' (Always take appropriate nursing action).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Therapeutic Communication Tips</h3>
                <h4>DO:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respond to feeling tone. (Acknowledge emotions).</li>
                    <li>Provide information. (Educate clients as needed).</li>
                    <li>Focus on the client. (Client-centered approach).</li>
                    <li>Use silence. (Allows client time to process and respond).</li>
                    <li>Use presence. (Be fully engaged and attentive).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>DO NOT:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask 'why' questions.</li>
                    <li>Ask 'yes/no' questions, except in the case of possible self-harm. (Limits communication).</li>
                    <li>Focus on the nurse. (Avoid self-disclosure that shifts focus).</li>
                    <li>Explore. (Avoid digging unnecessarily; maintain professional boundaries).</li>
                    <li>Do not say, “Don't worry!"</li>

                <h3>Rules for Delegation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**RN Assignment:** Cannot delegate assessment, teaching, or nursing judgment.</li>
                    <li>**LPN/LVN Assignment:** Assign stable clients with expected outcomes.</li>
                    <li>**UAP Assignment:** Delegate standard, unchanging procedures.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Five Rights of Delegation:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>**Right Task:** (Within scope of practice, stable client).</li>
                    <li>**Right Circumstances:** (Appropriate workload and client condition).</li>
                    <li>**Right Person:** (Competent and within their scope of practice).</li>
                    <li>**Right Communication:** (Clear, concise, specific task, expected results, follow-up).</li>
                    <li>**Right Supervision:** (Monitor, evaluate, intervene if necessary).</li>
                </ol>

                    "**STEP 5: Outcome of Remaining Answers:**\n    *   '\"Don't worry, our surgeons are highly skilled.\"': This is false reassurance and dismisses the client's feelings (NCLEX Trap: Do not say 'Don't worry!').\n    *   '\"You'll be fine, everyone gets nervous before surgery.\"': This is also false reassurance and minimizes the client's individual experience.\n    *   '\"It's normal to feel scared. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you?\"': This response validates the client's feelings, acknowledges their fear as normal, and then opens the door for further *assessment* of their specific anxieties. This is highly therapeutic and client-centered.\n    *   '\"I'm sure you've discussed these fears with the doctor, haven't you?\"': This is a 'yes/no' question which closes communication, and it shifts responsibility away from the nurse (Therapeutic Communication Tip: Do not ask 'yes/no' questions; Do not pass the buck)."
