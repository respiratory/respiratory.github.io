            <p><strong>Correct Placement:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Actions to Take:</strong> <em>Notify the healthcare provider immediately</em> and <em>Prepare the client for a fasciotomy</em>. The client's symptoms are classic for Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS), which is a limb-threatening emergency. The nurse's first action is to notify the provider for immediate medical intervention. The definitive treatment for ACS is a fasciotomy, so the nurse must anticipate this and prepare the client. Administering more opioids is incorrect as it masks the key symptom of ischemic pain. Elevating the limb is contraindicated as it can further reduce arterial blood flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Condition:</strong> <em>Acute Compartment Syndrome</em>. This condition is caused by swelling and bleeding within a confined muscle compartment, leading to increased pressure that compromises blood flow, nerve function, and muscle viability.</li>
                <li><strong>Parameters to Monitor:</strong> <em>Assess for increasing pain and paresthesia</em> and <em>Assess radial pulse and capillary refill</em>. Pain unrelieved by analgesia and paresthesia (numbness/tingling) are the earliest and most reliable indicators of ACS. Assessing the radial pulse and capillary refill monitors for vascular compromise; while pulselessness is a very late sign, diminished pulses and delayed refill are critical findings.</li>

                <li><strong>Prolonged Elevation on a Pillow:</strong> Contraindicated. While brief elevation can help with swelling in the immediate post-op period (first 24h), prolonged elevation, especially after 24-48 hours, promotes the development of hip flexion contractures and should be avoided.</li>
                <li><strong>Administer Gabapentin:</strong> Indicated. The client is describing phantom limb pain, which is neuropathic in nature. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant commonly used to effectively treat this type of pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply Lotion to Incision:</strong> Contraindicated. Lotions, creams, or ointments should not be applied to the incision line unless specifically prescribed, as they can trap moisture and increase the risk of infection.</li>

                <li><strong>Proper technique for PICC line care and flushing:</strong> The client/family must be able to safely manage the PICC line at home to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and maintain patency.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance of a high-protein, high-vitamin C diet:</strong> Adequate nutrition is essential for wound healing and supporting the body's immune response to fight the chronic infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Signs and symptoms of antibiotic-related complications:</strong> Long-term antibiotic use puts the client at risk for superinfections like Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) or fungal infections. The client must know to report symptoms such as persistent diarrhea immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> High-impact exercise is contraindicated as it can cause a pathologic fracture in the weakened bone. Sterile dressing changes are typically managed by a home health nurse, not independently by the client, due to the complexity and risk of contamination.</p>

            <p>The correct statement is: The nurse recognizes that the client's change in <strong>neurological status</strong> combined with respiratory distress and the presence of a <strong>petechial rash</strong> on the chest and axillae are hallmark signs of Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES). The nurse's immediate priority is to <strong>administer oxygen</strong> and place the client in a high-Fowler's position.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neurological Status:</strong> Early cerebral involvement in FES manifests as confusion, agitation, and decreased level of consciousness due to hypoxia and fat globules traveling to the brain.</li>
                <li><strong>Petechial Rash:</strong> A petechial rash, caused by microvascular hemorrhage, appearing on the conjunctiva, axillae, and upper chest is a classic, though not always present, sign of FES.</li>
                <li><strong>Administer Oxygen:</strong> The most critical aspect of FES is severe respiratory compromise (ARDS-like picture). Hypoxia is the greatest threat to life, making oxygen administration the absolute first priority to support vital organs.</li>

        <div class="question-scenario">
            <p><strong>Day 1, 0900:</strong> A 70-year-old female is admitted with an intracapsular fracture of the left hip. Buck's skin traction is applied preoperatively to reduce muscle spasms and immobilize the fracture. The client is alert and oriented, rating her pain at a 7/10.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 1, 1400:</strong> The nurse is assessing the client. The client reports her pain is now 4/10 after receiving analgesia. The nurse observes that the client's left foot is cool to the touch and the client reports a "pins and needles" sensation. The dorsalis pedis pulse is +1 via Doppler. The weights for the traction are resting on the floor.</p>

        <button onclick="showRationale('rationale5')">Show Rationale</button>
        <div class="rationale" id="rationale5">
            <h4>Rationale</h4>
            <p>The two immediate priority actions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lift the weights to ensure they are hanging freely:</strong> For traction to be effective, the weights must hang freely and not rest on the floor or bed. This is a primary principle of traction and, if corrected, may alleviate some of the client's symptoms. This is a problem the nurse can and must fix immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Notify the healthcare provider of the neurovascular changes:</strong> The coolness, paresthesia ("pins and needles"), and diminished pulse are signs of neurovascular compromise. This is a serious complication that threatens the viability of the limb and requires immediate medical evaluation and potential intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong> Loosening the straps might be necessary, but the provider should be notified first given the compromised circulation. Simply documenting and waiting is inappropriate when urgent action is needed. Administering more pain medication is incorrect as the issue is likely ischemic pain from compromised circulation, not just fracture pain.</p>
